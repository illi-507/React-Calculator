This ReactJS project is from freecodecamp
Techs:
1. Reuse of three React UI components
2. The use of "props.children" to get whatever is included between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
3. The use of an extensive math library: mathjs

Furthermore, this project also demonstrates how to deploy the web app to netlify and host the app.
